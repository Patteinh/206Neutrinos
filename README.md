# 206Neutrinos üëÅ

Welcome to **206neutrinos**.

This project involves calculating updated statistical measures for a series of neutrino observations.

## Language and Tools üõ†Ô∏è

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

- **Language:** Python
- **Compilation:** Via Makefile, including `re`, `clean`, and `fclean` rules.
- **Binary Name:** 206neutrinos

## Project Overview üîé

The goal of 206neutrinos is to create a program that updates statistical measures, such as arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, and standard deviation, as new neutrino observation values are entered.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Calculation:** Update statistical measures upon the entry of each new observation value.
- **Interactive Interface:** Allow users to enter new values interactively.
- **Statistical Measures:** Calculate the arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, root mean square, and standard deviation.

### Usage

```
‚àº> ./206neutrinos -h
USAGE
    ./206neutrinos n a h sd
DESCRIPTION
    n   number of values
    a   arithmetic mean
    h   harmonic mean
    sd  standard deviation
```

### Exemple

```
‚àº> ./206neutrinos 12000 297514 297912 4363
Enter next value: 299042
    Number of values:   12001
    Standard deviation: 4362.84
    Arithmetic mean:    297514.13
    Root mean square:   297546.11
    Harmonic mean:      297912.09

Enter next value: 302420
    Number of values:   12002
    Standard deviation: 4362.89
    Arithmetic mean:    297514.54
    Root mean square:   297546.52
    Harmonic mean:      297912.46

Enter next value: END
```
